// Compounded effect ideas
// 1. Grant a passive effect to (eligible) cards
// 2. Remove a passive effect from (eligible) cards
// 3. Apply an effect to (eligible) cards

// EXTRA A: Any of the above may be done if a condition is met (we have to define condition yet). Eligible cards follow conditions actually, but there may be other conditions

// General forge ideas
// TODO

const forges = {
